#### Pump Alert System

Addressing an agricultural issue sometimes requires unique solutions. The initial problem was the unreliability of a Honda WHP30HX water pump, which unpredictably stopped working in the middle of the hot day. However, these water outages affected the crop yield aggressively.


I created a system that detects these outages using a vibration sensor, which detects vibrations near the water pump. When an outage occurs, it sends an SMS to the owner's phone notifying them of the issue. The sensor is also controllable via messages.
